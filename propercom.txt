                                           { Total Number of Handshakes = n × (n – 1)/2
                                               Total Number of Handshakes = nC2 }	
21)19 peoples are there. total number of handshakes?
      ans)171
22)Each of the 55 houses gives a card to every other house.The total number of cards exchanged would be:
      ans) [Each house gives a card to 54 other houses. Since there are 55 houses, the total number of cards exchanged would be 55 * 54. 
            However, this counts each exchange twice (once for each house involved), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.
            Total cards = (55 * 54) / 2
             => 1485] answer is not accurate
23)8 people are write exam. how many way the result shown?
      ans) [For each person, there are 2 possibilities: pass or fail. Since there are 8 people, the total number of possible outcomes is:
